- question: "Can the definition of the same competency level vary between candidates?"
  answer: |
    **No.** The level definition remains fixed, according to the competency dictionary.

    What varies is **the justification**: it adapts to the critical incidents and evidence observed in each interview, which are unique for each candidate.

- question: "What information is generated for a competency?"
  answer: |
    Competencies are analyzed based on critical incidents mentioned in the conversation. From these critical incidents we extract:

    - Detected level and definition
    - Justification of detected level based on critical incidents
    - List of evidence
    - Recommendations on what points to probe further to improve competency evaluation
